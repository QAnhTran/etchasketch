Etch-a-sketch project
In this project, I am going to build a website application that functions similarly to an etch-a-sketch. In other words, the program is a panel which allows the user to draw by using the mouse as a pen. Color schemes will include black and RGB colors. After finishing the project, I will have been able to demonstrate skills that involve the use of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Specifically, the JavaScript will be integrated into the HTMl using the DOM to manipulate HTML classes and IDs. Additionally, the CSS will also be utilized in order to make the program as user-friendly as possible.
